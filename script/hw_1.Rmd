## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Loading table

The fastest way to load a csv file is by looking a subset and infer the classes from the subset
```{r Loading}
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(knitr)

initial <- read.csv("../data/hw1_data.csv")
classes <- sapply(initial, class)
data <- read.csv("../data/hw1_data.csv",
                   colClasses = classes)
```

## Printing first two rows

```{r 2 rows}
data[c(1:2),]
```
## Getting dimensions
```{r dimension}
dim(data)
```
## Getting last two rows
```{r last 2 rows}
tail(data, n=2)
```
## Finding row 47
```{r row 47}
data[47,]
```
## Finding NA
```{r NaN}
sum(is.na(data$Ozone))
```

```{r mean ozone}
mean(data$Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)            # Use na.rm option
```

```{r subset1}
subset1 <- data %>% filter(data$Ozone > 31, data$Temp > 90)
mean(subset1$Solar.R)
```
```{r subset2}
subset2 <- data %>% filter(data$Month == 6)
mean(subset2$Temp)

```
```{r subset3}
subset3 <- data %>%  filter(data$Month == 5)
max(subset3$Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)

```
